Oh no! I dropped my laptop on the ground and the course code spilled out all over the floor!

I threw all the lines of code back into a text file, but none of the lines are in order.

Plus, a bunch of end brackets fell down a sewer grate, so those will have to be added in as well.

Use editpad or notepad and rearrange the code so that it will run a little rock-paper-scissors application in your web browser.

Here are some tips:

1. Use each line of code once and only once.
2. Do not write any of your own code.
3. Group similar looking pieces of code together as you are starting out.
4. Do not write any of your own code.
5. Group HTML tag elements together and elements that look like code together
6. Do not write any of your own code.
7. When you think your done, save the file as rps.html and open it in a web browser and see if it works!!!
